# Personal HTML Portfolio

This is my **first HTML portfolio**, created to showcase my skills, education, and projects. I recently learned HTML and built this project to practice structuring a web page and adding content like text, images, lists, tables, and a contact form.

## Features
- **About Me** section with a short bio and photo
- **Skills** listed using HTML lists
- **Projects** section to highlight mini projects
- **Education** table with 10th, 12th, and B.Tech details
- **Contact Form** for visitors to reach out
- **Footer** with social links

## Next Steps
- Learning **CSS** to style the portfolio and make it visually appealing
- Adding more projects and interactive features
